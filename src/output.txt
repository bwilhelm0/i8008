-- Running command `read_verilog -sv debugbus.sv i8008_core.sv; synth_ice40 -json build/synthesis.json -top top' --

1. Executing Verilog-2005 frontend: debugbus.sv
Parsing SystemVerilog input from `debugbus.sv' to AST representation.
Warning: Encountered `parallel_case' comment! Such legacy hot comments are supported by Yosys, but are not part of any formal language specification. Using the Verilog `parallel_case' attribute or the SystemVerilog `unique' or `priority' keywords is recommended!
Generating RTLIL representation for module `\debug_harness'.
Successfully finished Verilog frontend.
